2021-02-05,yeah by default engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are goodhigher isp tooit was foolish of us not to start 3 engines amp immediately shut down 1 as 2 are needed to landyesyes but engines havemin throttle point where there is flameout risk so landing on 3 engines means high thrust weight further away from hover point which is also riskyittruefranz was essentialintuitively it would seem so but turbopump fed raptors have much higher thrust amp propellant mass fraction than pressure fed gas thrusters amp they re already therewill still use hot gas maneuvering rcs thrusters as 5x more efficient than nitrogen 300 sec vs 60 sec ispthat said the ship landing burn hasclear solution my greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid amp full reusability without which we shall forever be confined to earthdestinyyes

2021-03-06,was super fun tbh hahaor is this just fantasystarhopper is an old timer who has seenlot of thingsif you want the tesla full self driving beta downloaded to your car let us know doubling beta program size now with 8 2 amp probably 10x size with 8 3 still be careful but itgetting maturethis was way past leg loads they got squashed hardbeta v8 3 has literally 1000 improvements will take time to qa internally before release probably in two or three weeksdoge spelled backwards is egodthrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present hence hard touchdown we ve never seen this before next time min two engines all the way to the ground amp restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues
2021-03-07,due to high levels of demand for fsd beta adding download beta button to service section of car display in 10 daysavailability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and or tesla internal development amp testing note word beta is used to reduce complacency in usage amp set expectations appropriately all software is first tested internally by tesla simulation amp qa drive teamsthe tesla fsd computer started shipping in volume in q2 2019 2020 cars should all have fsd computers whether or not ordered as an optionshould be very soon many subtle differences between us amp canada roads so harder than it seemsthe 1400 is mostly good imo ubi lite as the people get to choose how the money is spent but the rest is mostly net bad for the people aswhole though it is obviously characterized otherwiseupdate probably in q2 cybertruck will be built at giga texas so focus right now is on getting that beast built

2021-03-09,we will ask the regulatorsbuild 8 3 of fsd should be done qa testing by end of next week so thatroughly when download button should show upnot connecting tesla cars to starlink as our terminal is much too big this is for aircraft ships large trucks amp rvsdelamain ai cabs should be able to drive themselves when you re in them amp be electric by 2077it until you make itassuming user approves warning amp agrees to drive carefully it will download latest qa tested fsd beta build as soon as car connects to wifi
2021-03-10,i was just up there elevator on the other side floor is in glass coming soonyeah we talked about that internally could just have it land onbig net or bouncy castle lacks dignity but would work but optimized landing propellant is only 5 of dry mass so itnotgamechangerbattery energy density is the key to electric aircraft autonomy for aircraft could have been donelong time ago modern airliners are very close to autonomousmight just catch the ship with the launch tower same as boosterfair point if autogenous pressurization had been used ch4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh which happened in prior flight my fault for approving sounded good at the timesn10 engine was low on thrust due probably to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank impact of 10mcrushed legs amp part of skirt multiple fixes in work for sn11there were baffles but one may have acted likestraw to suck bubbles in from above liquid gas level something similar happened on an early falcon 1 flight resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff
2021-03-11,transparent aluminum alon might be coolcelebratingyear of great work by the spacex teamwowdieses jahrlike but with self driving hahaif 2021 manifest is met spacex will do 75 of total earth payload to orbit with falconsingle starship is designed to do inday what all rockets on earth currently do inyear even so 1000 starships will take 20 years to buildself sustaining city on marsyesfalcon 9 is almost always at max capacity when it has spare performance it flies back to land which costs much less than usingdroneship our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time last year spacex launched roughly double payload mass of rest of worldfuel cells should be called fool sells suchsilly choice for cars not great even forrocket upper stage imo but at least not absurd

2021-08-03,2008 was an extremely tough year on every leveli was asked byreporter ifwas optimistic or pessimistic about spacexfuture that was my answerhard to believe itbeen 15 years already those goals actually precede the creation of tesla by many years goes back to probably 1992 whenwas in college however at the timethought the chance of achieving those goals was very lowvery close to real arms are able to move during descent to match exact booster position catch point is off to side in case catch fails donwant to hit launch mount booster is transferred back to launch mount for next flight designed to have lt 1 hour turnaroundthatabout right civilization can be powered withvery small of earth having solar panelswe stole the idea from karate kidsuper heavy booster moving to orbital launch mountthanks sandypitch control requires more force than yaw amp much more force than roll also grid fins closer to or in the wake of the booster are less effective however pretty good aero control can technically be achieved with only 2 grid fins with some effect on accuracyit was difficult
2021-08-04,the sheer amount of time tesla has spent dealing with bike lane is staggering short answer yesi do love nasa always haveall 6 engines mounted to first orbital starshipittruemars looks amazingjust want to say thanks to those in government who fight hard for the right thing to happen despite extreme pressure to do otherwise therein lies the core goodness of the american statei thought we had lost for sure we were justtiny company back then only 1 of 4 launches got to orbit amphad no money left out of the bluefew days before christmas nasa calls to say we wonthat is the goal our official name is actually space exploration technologies spacex is short formi do think that great design amp engineering of products are critical but manufacturing amp supply chain require orders of magnitude more work
